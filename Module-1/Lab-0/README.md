## Summary
CPU is usage, but all three were 0% with 2 vCPUs. Each free tier size has different memory sizes. All three had the same size disk and usage amount. Uptime was how long the instance was running. 

Each instance further helped me recall the process from Class 6. No errors were encountered other than removing the cobwebs from my memory. I don’t see any instances running but I do see the launch template still available.
